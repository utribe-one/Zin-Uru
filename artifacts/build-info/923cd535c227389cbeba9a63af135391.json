This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role\n members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some\n applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see\n {AccessControlEnumerable}.\n Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed\n in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\n using `public constant` hash digests:\n ```\n bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n ```\n Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a\n function call, use {hasRole}:\n ```\n function foo() public {\n     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));\n     ...\n }\n ```\n Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and\n {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n {_setRoleAdmin}.\n WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure\n accounts that have been granted it."

This means\n that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.\n For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.\n TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide\n https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How\n to implement supply mechanisms].\n We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead\n of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional\n and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.\n Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.\n This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just\n by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit\n these events, as it isn't required by the specification.\n Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}\n functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting\n allowances. See {IERC20-approve}."

When a snapshot is created, the balances and\n total supply at the time are recorded for later access.\n This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.\n In naive implementations it's possible to perform a \"double spend\" attack by reusing the same balance from different\n accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be\n used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.\n Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a\n snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot\n id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id\n and the account address.\n ==== Gas Costs\n Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log\n n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much\n smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.\n There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is\n only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent\n transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on."

A safe way to ensure\n this is by receiving a hash of the original message (which may otherwise\n be too long), and then calling {toEthSignedMessageHash} on it."

Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding\n they need in their contracts using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`.\n This contract implements the EIP 712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding\n scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA\n ({_hashTypedDataV4}).\n The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating\n the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain.\n NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as \"v4\", as implemented by the JSON RPC method\n https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask].\n _Available since v3.4._"
